## Full Calendars JS in Lightning web component
I have started this project with base from https://github.com/Gurenax/sfdx-lwc-fullcalendarjs and extended further with add and remove events.

## Description of Files and Directories
1. `lwc/fullCalendarJs` - FullCalendarJS Lightning Web Component
2. `staticresources/FullCalendarJS` - JS and CSS files.
3. `FullCalendarController.cls` - Apex controller to receive the data

## Future improvements
Drag and drop functionality
